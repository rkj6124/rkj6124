- 👋 Hi, I’m @rkj6124 (Ravi Kumar Jha). I'm a software developer and I love building things which go way back to when I started painting and realised I love making things, I created new things when I painterd which later on transformed to my love for prgramming. Its almost like a superpower I can build anything I like. 
- 👀 I don't have driving license.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects and build new things.
- 📫 You can reach me at rkjproton@gmail.com
