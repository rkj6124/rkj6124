- 👋 Hi, I’m @rkj6124 (Ravi Kumar Jha). 
- I'm a software developer and I love building things which go way back to when I started painting as a 2yr old kid and growing up eventually I realised that I love making things, I created new things whenever I painterd. My love for building and creating new things later on transformed to my love for programming. To me it feels almost like a superpower I can build anything I like. 
- 👀 I'm 24 yrs old and I don't have driving license.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects and build new things.
- 📫 You can reach me at rkjproton@gmail.com
